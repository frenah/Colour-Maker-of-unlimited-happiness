# Colour-Maker-of-unlimited-happiness

I made this with a tutorial and then played around with the code to make it how I wanted it.
I slightly modified the html, other than that the only code that I personly wrote is the script.js

The Tutorial is: https://github.com/codebar/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/js/lesson3/tutorial.md

Basically you enter RGB values between 0-255 to make colours and it's really excting.
Every time you refresh the page or add a new colour to your favourites it generates another random colour.
This feature helps if you lack creativity.
Or you're colorblind and want to pretend you're doing a colour.
Realistically it's just really fun making lots of colour appear in the page.
Oh and if you move the mouse over one of your favourite colours then the preview box becomes that colour! #Excite
